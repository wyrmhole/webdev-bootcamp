      <em>A <strong>code user</strong> looking to explore his potential</em>

    <p>
      For as long as I can remember, I've always been interested in computer science. Even before I knew what computer science was. I've wanted to build apps and webpages, make video games, hack into Gaia Online to increase my in-game currency. I always viewed reaching these goals as overwhelming and stopped myself before I failed. Little did I know that all those goals can be reached and the first step is to take this Web Development Udemy course and start learning how to code.
